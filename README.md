<h2>🛠️Tools & Technologies Used:</h2><br>

To achieve this Task2 of level 3, I used the following tools and technologies:<br>

1. Python – used as a programming language for data analysis
2. NumPy – used for efficient numerical computations
3. Pandas – used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
4. Matplotlib – used for creating visualizations like charts and plots
5. Seaborn – used for advanced statistical data visualization
6.  Jupyter Notebook (Primary IDE) - used for writing and executing code.

These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.<br><br>
