  <body>

<h2>üîπProject Overview:</h2>

In this project, I analyzed a given restaurant dataset to explore insights on:
1. Identify the restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes and
2. Analyze if there is a correlation betweEn the number of votes and the rating of a resstaurant

<h2>üîπ Key Insights: </h2>
After performing a thorough analysis, here are the findings:<br>

The Highest number of Votes: Restaurant Name      Toit
Votes               10934
Aggregate rating      4.8
Name: 728, dtype: object
_______________________________________________________________

The Lowest number of Votes: Restaurant Name     Cantinho da Gula
Votes                              0
Aggregate rating                 0.0

_______________________________________________________________
The Correlation Between Votes and Rating: 0.31
  

<h2>üõ†Ô∏èTools & Technologies Used:</h2><br>

To achieve this Task2 of level 3, I used the following tools and technologies:<br>

1. Python ‚Äì used as a programming language for data analysis
2. NumPy ‚Äì used for efficient numerical computations
3. Pandas ‚Äì used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
4. Matplotlib ‚Äì used for creating visualizations like charts and plots
5. Seaborn ‚Äì used for advanced statistical data visualization
6.  Jupyter Notebook (Primary IDE) - used for writing and executing code.

These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.<br><br>
